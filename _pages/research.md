### Scattering problems in unbounded interfaces
I have developed a method for solving a class of decomposable scattering scattering problems in complicated unbounded domains. If the computational domain can be split into simple subdomains (such as straight waveguides or periodic gratings), then the domain Green's functions for each piece can be used to reduce the scattering problem to an integral equation on the domain boundaries. The resulting integral equation can then be analytically continued to the complex plane, where it can be safely truncated and discretized using standard integral equation techniques.

### A fast solver for surface PDEs
I showed that 2D Green's for elliptic problems can be used to reformulate elliptic surface PDEs as a well conditioned surface integral equation. I then developed a singular quadrature scheme and fast direct solver allowing the resulting integral equation to be accurately discretized and efficiently solved.
