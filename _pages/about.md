Hi! And welcome to my W.I.P. website! I am a PhD Student in mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in New York. I have been conducting my research under the supervision of Mike O'Neil in the Fast algorithms at Courant group. My research currently focuses on several aspects of solving elliptic surface PDEs.
