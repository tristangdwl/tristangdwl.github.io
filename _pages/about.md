I am a William H. Kruskal Instructor in the Committee for Computational and Applied Mathematics in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago. My research uses the tools of numerical analysis and applied analysis to develop new fast algorithms for numerically solving PDEs. My recent work includes a new integral equation method for solving elliptic PDEs on surfaces, new integral equation methods for studying topological insulators, and a study of the regularity of the Laplace-Beltrami equation on surfaces with edges and corners.
